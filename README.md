Runner Boy is a top-view running game where the user controls a boy using the arrow keys and space bar. The user moves, jumps, and dodges obstacles while collecting gems or coins. Each gem increase speed and score. As the game continues, it gets faster and harder with fun sounds, music, and cool effects.
